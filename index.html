							"<a href="https://www.gconsultservices.blogspot.com/2015/07/shareholder-vs-stakeholder-whats.html">gconnect</a></h4>
			  			<h6 >Over time, the word shareholder and stakeholder has been used, interchangeably with the notion that they mean the same thing. Though there is a little resemblance in the spelling but have different pronunciation and meaning.

			  			<h6 >This piece will serve as an eye opener to the previous misuse of the word 'mentor'.

						The Oxford Learner's English Dictionary defined a mentor as a trusted adviser. 
						Over the years I have come to discover that most of the time we misuse the word 'Mentor' without paying much attention into the real meaning of the word.

						<h6>"An idol mind is the devil's workshop." Many have wasted their leisure time because they know not what to do with it, and when you know not what to do with your leisure time, the devil creep into you mind. And that result to evil thought (thought of immorality, stealing, killing etc.) flowing into the mind. The truth is that many don't know what to do with their leisure time because if they do, they will make profitable use out of the free or leisure time they get. And that's what I'm going to share with you. Five things to do with your leisure time...</h6>

 						If you ask me the difference between you and the likes of Bill Gate, Dangote is the number of people that are working for them. Do you know they have more than 24 hours in a day even though everyone is entitled to just 24hour?...
